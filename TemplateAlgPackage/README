0).copy the whole folder TemplateAlgPackage/ to your work dir.TemplateAlgPackage's path: /afs/ihep.ac.cn/users/l/lidj/file/TemplateAlgPackage
1).come into TemplateAlgPackage/
2).make sure you are using bash shell.switch from tcsh to bash,just key in
    $bash
  then
    $source NewPackage.sh NewPackage
  note:NewPackage is the name of your own package.

  the fundamental codes and functions have been included in it,so you can begin your work immediately with no worry about missing fundamental *.h files or having no ideas how to get events from *.root files.it can save much time during your preparation work.
4).visit cmt/
5).configure your environment for compiling , for example
    $source /afs/ihep.ac.cn/users/l/lidj/.laf_opt
6).start to compile your code
    $cmt config
    $source setup.csh
    $source setup.csh
    $cmt make
  then you compile your code successfully.
7).come to run/ , modify gen.sh
     6 inputFILELISTPATH="/afs/ihep.ac.cn/users/l/lidj/file/runlist/P12C/whole/GoodRun-part2-v0"
     7 outPUTFILEPATH="/tempoutpath"
     8 #useFILE1="TOutputSvc.Output" #if not use FILE1 ,just comment out this line
     9 outputFile1Name="RUNNUM_hists.root"
    10 outputFile2Name="RUNNUM_IBD.root"
    11 useRPC="FALSE"
  note:the 6th line:the path of your input files ,don't include the site variable ,e.g. EH1 EH2 EH3
  7th:the path of your output files ,don't include the site variable ,make sure that the directory exists
  8th:if not using FILE1 ,just comment out this line,FILE2 is default.to aviod saving useless information while you use LiveTimeSvc or MuonVeto tool
  9th and 10th:names of your output files ,with no need for modifying "outputFile1Name" while not using FILE1.
  11th:if using PRC muon veto ,choose TRUE
8).with no need for modifying config_temp.txt and job_temp.csh ,they will be modified by gen.sh automaticly.
9).make sure you are using bash shell.switch from tcsh to bash,just key in
    $bash
  then 
    $source gen.sh
  job files are created into run/EH1 run/EH2 run/EH3,e.g.config_22560.txt job_22560.csh submit.sh 
10).submit jobs to IHEP's job server
    $source run/EH1/submit.sh
    $source run/EH2/submit.sh
    $source run/EH3/submit.sh
11).wait for running.
